<h2>Purpose and rationale</h2>
<section class="full"><br>
                    <p>Perhaps the ideal way to identify bees is to hand off your specimens to a trained specialist, someone fluent in the complicated vocabulary of taxonomy. However, there are nowhere near enough experts available, so most of us will have to work through keys and puzzle over tricky characters to arrive at an ID. With this resource, the  aim is to at least de-mystify the terminology. Also:  note that vocabulary and observation are linked: if you know half a dozen terms describing surface sculpture, you will begin to see the details that distinguish them. Then, when you write your own taxonomic resources, you will provide more precise guidance to your own audience. 
                        
                    <p> This glossary covers most of what you will encounter in typical keys. The universe of all technical terms is much larger. For these consider two other resources free on the internet:  <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a849d4c8dd041c9c07a8e4c/t/5ad3bc968a922d44a4728936/1523825933048/Michener+2007+The+Bees+of+the+World.pdf">The Bees of the World</a>, by Michener is a comprehensive treatment of morphology, biology, identification of ... bees of the world. The <a href="http://api.hymao.org/public/label/list_all">Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology Portal</a> has definitions for thousands of terms, though many relate to non-bee taxa.</p>
